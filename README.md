You don't like having your search terms appear on every tab when using Firefox,
you say?

Why, Unsearched will clear the search bar for you everytime you navigate to a
new tab!

I know what you are thinking: wouldn't it be nice to also have the search term
to re-appear on the tabs that you actually used the search box on? Unsearched
won't disappoint.

By golly, install this wonderful add-on. It won't even make your Firefox
restart. That's a promise!
