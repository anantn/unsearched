You don't like having your search terms appear on every tab when using Firefox,
you say?

Why, Unsearched will clear the search bar for you everytime you navigate to a
new tab!

I know what you are thinking: wouldn't it be nice if the search terms magically
re-appeared on tabs that you actually used the search box on? Unsearched
won't disappoint.

By golly, [install this wonderful
add-on](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/unsearched/). It won't
even make your Firefox restart. That's a promise!
